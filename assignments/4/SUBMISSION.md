Description:
I created a functioning basic calculator design based on the calculator we have on our mobile devices that allows for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, clear (AC), and any other necessary operations as well as keyboard support. Javascript was used to manage the state and process the user inputs dynamically. ES^ features were applied, such as arrow functions and 'const'/'let' declarations to keep the code clean. The calulator layout was integrated with CSS grid for a design that would fit regardless of screen size and added the calculator to my portfolio with a dedicated project card and navigation links between the calculator itself and the portfolio.

Challenges: 
Some challenges I faced when it came to implementing the calculator was using multiple operations in a row which I solved by using a "small state object", essentially a object that helps manage related data that changes over time, managing and updating the state.

I used the IOS calculator as a reference point and made some slight changes here and there.
